    <h1>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your
        learning process?</h1>
    <p>I really enjoyed the online lectures, along with the help after
        school through text message. The speed of response and the amount
        of help I had was extremely crucial in me passing this class and
        understanding the process and rules of coding. It also helped
        with fixing and seeing my the errors I made through the videos
        you personally made for me for the assignments.
    </p>
    <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
    <p>I personally would consider changing the class to a hybrid in-class/online class,
        as it would help with the money people spend on transportation.
        You can also have the ease of watching the video at the time you
        so people can still work whenever I can. I also would keep the
        classes small as you have them now, as it really helped me with
        the ease of communication with you and the amount of one on one
        I was able to get as well.
    </p>
    <h3>Did you learn what you expected in this course?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! This course taught me so much that I had no idea about!
        I have always been interested in the learning the language of
        coding, and this class has absolutely taught me that! While I
        still have a lot to learn in the following classes, I felt I got
        a massive amount of information in these past few weeks, and
        honestly more than I was expecting!
    </p>
    <h4>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already
        encountered in the past?</h4>
    <p>I had no prior knowledge of coding, so nearly everything was new
        to me! All of the concepts we went over were extremely complex and
        not at all anything I was previously familiar with. That said this
        class taught me so much!
